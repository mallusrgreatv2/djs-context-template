# DJS Context Template

This is a Typescript Discord.js bot template which includes command & event handler. What makes this template special is that it has [djs-context](https://npm.im/djs-context) npm package support, so it is called a "hybrid" command bot (commands can be used with both messages and slash commands)


## Setup

1. Copy the `.env.example` to a new file called `.env` and then fill out the token and prefix.
2. Run `npm i` (`yarn` preferred if you have yarn) command to install packages.
3. Run `npm start` to start the bot.
4. When the bot is running, execute command `deploy` in the command line to deploy all bot commands.
